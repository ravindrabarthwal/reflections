What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    Initializig a repo alert the git that it should be versioned and we can ourself
    commit to create versions of it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    Working directory includes the current both files tracked or untracked and
    repository consist multiple screenshot of staging area. Staging area consist
    of those files only which are added or you can say tracked. It offers that
    we should commit only 1 logical change at a time.
